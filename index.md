This workshop will be held at the [32nd IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)](https://2021.ieee-iv.org/), planned for July 11-15, 2021, in Nagoya, Japan.

## Contributions

Submissions are welcome via [papercept](https://its.papercept.net/). Please use our workshop code `w2cw1` for your submission. Submission deadline is March 29, 2021.
See [https://2021.ieee-iv.org/workshops/](https://2021.ieee-iv.org/workshops/) for details on the workshop paper submission.
Please get in touch with the organizers in case you have any further questions.

## Scope and Topics

The topics of interest of the workshop include, but are not limited to,
- Cooperative and comprehensible motion planning
- Probabilistic decision making and motion planning (including MDPs, POMDPs, MMDPs)
- Probabilistic behavior prediction (with help of semantic high definition maps)
- Evaluation and benchmarking for probabilistic prediction
- Evaluation and benchmarking for comprehensible motion planning
